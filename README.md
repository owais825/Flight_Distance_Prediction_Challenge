# Flight_Distance_Prediction_Challenge
This is the hackathon conducted by MachineHack.com
Tech Stack: Python,Sci-kit learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ridge, lasso ,XGBoost etc.
Tackled a regression challenge to predict flight distances using flight and environmental data, applying extensive feature
engineering and preprocessing techniques.
Evaluated models like Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost, and LightGBM using RMSE, achieving the best score with Lasso and
securing 6th place on a top data science platform..
